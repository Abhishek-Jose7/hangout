# Future Features Roadmap

## 1. 📅 Calendar & Scheduling
*   **Export to Calendar**: One-click button to add the finalized itinerary to Google Calendar/Outlook/Apple Calendar.
*   **Availability Finder**: Before deciding *where*, decide *when*. Allow users to input their free time slots and find the overlapping time for the group.

## 2. 💰 Expense Management
*   **Split the Bill**: Integrated expense tracker.
    *   "Who paid?" functionality during the hangout.
    *   Automatic calculation of "who owes who" at the end.
*   **Budget Alerts**: Warn users if the selected itinerary exceeds their stated budget.

## 3. 🚕 Logistics & Travel
*   **Ride Integration**: Deep links to Uber/Ola with the destination pre-filled.
*   **Transit Directions**: Show public transport options to the meeting point for each member.

## 4. 🌦️ Context Awareness
*   **Weather Integration**: Check the forecast for the meeting time.
    *   *Logic*: If rain is forecast > 50%, filter out "Nature Walk" and "Outdoor Dining" and boost "Bowling", "Movies", "Malls".
*   **Traffic Check**: Estimate travel time based on current traffic conditions (would require Google Maps Traffic API).

## 5. 📱 Social & Engagement
*   **Group Chat**: Simple built-in chat for the group to discuss options while voting.
*   **Photo Gallery**: Allow users to upload photos to the group after the hangout to preserve memories.
*   **User Profiles**: Save "Favorite Places" and "Default Preferences" (e.g., "I always like Italian food") so they don't have to type it every time.

## 6. 🎮 Gamification
*   **"Spin the Wheel"**: If the group can't decide (voting is tied), add a fun "Spin the Wheel" feature to pick a random winner from the top choices.
*   **Ranked Voting**: Allow users to rank options (1st, 2nd, 3rd) instead of just one vote, for a more consensus-driven result.
